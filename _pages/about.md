I am a junior research fellow at New York University and Fordham University. In NYU, my mentors are [Nikhil Gupta](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/nikhil-gupta), [Susheem Kanwar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/susheem-kanwar/) and [Jiangce Chen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jiangce-achez-chen-4852301a3/). In Fordham, I am under the guidance of [Camelia Prodan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/camelia-prodan-762b097a/) and [Koorosh Esteki](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eXIhPdQAAAAJ&hl=en).


Research interests
------
My research in NYU focuses on developing and characterizing composite materials by systematically varying concentrations of constituent components such as fly ash, carbon, and microspheres. The goal is to engineer materials optimized for performance across diverse mechanical and thermal conditions, including tensile and compressive stress, elevated temperatures, and vibrational frequencies. This investigation supports the broader aim of advancing multi-functional materials for structural and acoustic applications, laying the groundwork for materials that respond adaptively to their environments and can be integrated into next-generation manufacturing systems.

My research at Fordham investigates the behavior of quantum resonators and their coupling mechanisms to explore energy transport and spectral properties in solid-state systems. By analyzing the frequency response and energy gaps of resonator arrays, modeled as analogs for atomic structures and protein dynamics, we aim to better understand how quantum and classical behaviors emerge in engineered materials. Using simulation tools like COMSOL and experimental techniques including 3D-printed prototypes, this work contributes to the development of tunable, low-dimensional systems with potential applications in quantum materials, phononic devices, and energy-efficient technologies.
